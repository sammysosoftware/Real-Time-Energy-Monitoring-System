## **Market Potential & Cost Analysis**
- **Initial Build Cost:** $25,000 purchase price + $20,000 in modifications and upgrades (~$45,000 total investment).  
- **Comparable Market Prices:** Similar spec trailers sell for **$100,000 to $250,000**, but weigh significantly more (6,000-8,000 lbs).  
- **Unique Selling Point:** This trailer is **under 4,000 lbs**, allowing it to be towed by a **mid-sized SUV** rather than a full-size truck.  
- **Projected Retail Price:** Given its high-end features, an asking price of **$80,000 to $100,000** is fair, considering weight, insulation, and energy independence.  
- **Future Manufacturing Feasibility:** If manufactured in bulk, build costs could be reduced to **$25,000-$30,000**, allowing for a competitive retail price of **$50,000-$70,000**, which would dominate the lightweight off-grid trailer market.
