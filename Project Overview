# Off-Grid Solar Energy System â€“ Custom RV Prototype

## Project Overview

### **Introduction**
The **Off-Grid Solar Energy System** is a **high-performance, self-sustaining power solution** designed for a **custom-built camper trailer**. This project was initiated as a hands-on research and development (R&D) effort to explore **high-efficiency solar energy solutions for off-grid living**. The goal was to create a **fully autonomous energy system** that could support long-term travel, boondocking, and sustainable living without reliance on external power sources.

### **Project Goals**
- **Develop a fully integrated off-grid power system** capable of supporting essential appliances and comfort features.
- **Enhance energy efficiency and sustainability** through high-density solar panels, battery storage, and smart power management.
- **Ensure year-round usability** with enhanced **thermal insulation and cold-weather resilience**.
- **Optimize charging solutions** with a **solar array, DC-to-DC charger (tow vehicle), and AC-to-DC shore power charger**.
- **Improve interior functionality** with custom-built cabinetry, a fully enclosed wet room, and an ergonomic kitchen setup.

### **Problem Statement**
Most commercially available RVs and camper trailers **lack sufficient off-grid capabilities** for full-time living. They often rely heavily on generator power, inefficient layouts, and **poor insulation**, making them unsuitable for extreme weather conditions. This project addresses these limitations by designing a **custom off-grid solution** that is **energy-efficient, well-insulated, and engineered for reliability**.

- **Solar Power System:** 800W high-efficiency solar panels capable of generating **3kW+ in full sunlight**.
- **Battery Bank:** 5 kWh lithium-ion battery storage, expandable to **20 kWh**.
- **Multi-Source Charging:**
  - **Solar via MPPT charge controller** (80A)
  - **DC-to-DC charging from tow vehicle**
  - **AC-to-DC shore power charging**
- **Advanced Power Distribution:**
  - **12V and 24V DC circuits** (for efficiency and redundancy)
  - **120V AC circuits via 2000W pure sine inverter**
  - **Smart circuit monitoring & breaker-protected distribution panels**
- **Cold Weather Performance:**
  - Increased **wall thickness from 1 inch to 3.5 inches**
  - **4-6 inches of insulation in ceiling & floor**
  - Fully insulated water tanks to prevent freezing
  - Furnace with reinforced & insulated wiring to withstand extreme temperatures
- **Interior Buildout:**
  - **Fully enclosed 3' x 3' wet room** (shower, foot-operated toilet, sink)
  - **Full-sized propane-powered 12V refrigerator**
  - **Kitchen with 3-burner propane stove & 1500W induction cooktop**
  - **Hardwood cabinetry, custom seating, and collapsible Murphy-style bed**
  - **LED lighting with dimmable, remote-controlled settings**
- **Custom Electrical Cabinet:**
  - Houses all **main electrical components** securely
  - Ensures **safe ventilation & organized wiring management**
